# ðŸš€ Coolify Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your marketing dashboard to Coolify with proper configuration and environment setup.

## Prerequisites
- Coolify instance running
- Git repository with your code
- Domain name (optional but recommended)
- API credentials for your integrations

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Preparation
Your repository is already prepared with:
- âœ… Multi-stage Dockerfile
- âœ… Health checks
- âœ… Environment variable support
- âœ… Production build process

### 2. Coolify Application Setup

#### Step 1: Create New Application
1. Log into your Coolify dashboard
2. Click "New Application"
3. Select "Docker Compose" as the deployment method
4. Connect your Git repository

#### Step 2: Configure Application
- **Name**: `dashboard`
- **Repository**: Your Git repository URL
- **Branch**: `main` (or your preferred branch)
- **Docker Compose File**: `coolify-deploy.yml`

#### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables in Coolify:

**Required:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-session-secret-here
```

**Optional (based on your integrations):**
```
# BigCommerce
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=your-store-hash

# Google
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID=your-ga-property-id

# Meta/Facebook
META_APP_ID=your-meta-app-id
META_APP_SECRET=your-meta-app-secret
```

#### Step 4: Domain Configuration
1. Add your domain in Coolify
2. Enable SSL (Coolify handles this automatically)
3. Set up any subdomains if needed

#### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy" in Coolify
2. Monitor the build process
3. Check the logs for any issues

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Health Check
Your application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health`. Verify it's working:
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "services": {
    "bigcommerce": "configured",
    "google": "configured",
    "googleAnalytics": "configured",
    "meta": "configured"
  },
  "businesses": 0
}
```

#### API Endpoints
Verify these endpoints are accessible:
- Frontend: `https://yourdomain.com/`
- API Health: `https://yourdomain.com/api/health`
- Dashboard API: `https://yourdomain.com/api/dashboard`
- Business Management: `https://yourdomain.com/api/businesses`

### 4. Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Logs
- Access logs through Coolify dashboard
- Monitor for any errors or issues
- Check application performance

#### Updates
- Push changes to your Git repository
- Coolify will automatically rebuild and deploy
- Monitor the deployment process

#### Scaling
- Coolify supports horizontal scaling
- Adjust resources as needed
- Monitor resource usage

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check Docker build logs

#### 2. Environment Variables
- Ensure all required variables are set
- Check variable names match exactly
- Verify no extra spaces or quotes

#### 3. Port Issues
- Application runs on port 3000
- Coolify handles port mapping automatically
- Check health check configuration

#### 4. API Integration Issues
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Check CORS configuration
- Ensure proper redirect URIs are set

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check application logs
docker logs dashboard-app

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check environment variables
docker exec dashboard-app env
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization

### 1. Caching
- Static assets are cached for 1 year
- API responses use cache manager
- Consider CDN for global performance

### 2. Database
- Current setup uses file-based storage
- Consider PostgreSQL for production scale
- Implement proper backup strategy

### 3. Monitoring
- Enable Coolify monitoring
- Set up alerts for downtime
- Monitor API rate limits

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use Coolify's secure environment variable storage
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 2. API Security
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 3. Container Security
- Application runs as non-root user
- Regular security updates
- Minimal attack surface

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Strategy

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Coolify supports multiple instances
- Load balancing handled automatically
- Monitor resource usage

### 2. Database Scaling
- Consider external database service
- Implement connection pooling
- Regular backups and maintenance

### 3. CDN Integration
- Use Cloudflare or similar CDN
- Cache static assets globally
- Reduce server load

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Coolify** using the steps above
2. **Configure your domain** and SSL
3. **Set up monitoring** and alerts
4. **Test all integrations** thoroughly
5. **Monitor performance** and optimize as needed
